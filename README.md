# Simon Game

The online version of Simon is a pattern-matching game. In this creation, a key (any) must be pressed to start the game after opening. It starts with floatingly popping up a random color button on the screen; following this, that popped-up button needs to be pressed. Then again, another button will randomly pop up; now, to continue the game, the prior sequence must be maintained while pressing - that is, the buttons popped up before must be pressed prior to pressing the currently popped up button.
